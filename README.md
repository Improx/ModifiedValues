# ModifiedValues
ModifiedValues is a C# library for Unity that enables modifying numeric values while keeping track of the modifiers.

### Quick Example

You're making a buff system for your game. Instead of having a classic float variable on your character

```
float Speed = 10;
```

You can create a Modified version of it:

```
ModifiedFloat Speed = 10;
```
