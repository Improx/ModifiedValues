# ModifiedValues
ModifiedValues is a C# library for Unity that enables modifying numeric values while keeping track of the modifiers.

### Quick Example

You're making a buff system for your game. Instead of having a `float Speed = 10;` variable on your character, you can have a `ModifiedFlot Speed = 10;` object.
